# Quark-Tac-Toe-A-Particle-Physics-Mini-Game-on-Arduino
This project combines a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with elementary particle physics concepts using the Arduino platform and a 3.5" resistive touchscreen display. Players interact with a 3x3 grid using particle symbols instead of traditional X and O, learning about quarks, leptons, and their interactions through gameplay. The goal is to create a hands-on educational experience thatâ€™s both fun and scientifically enriching.
