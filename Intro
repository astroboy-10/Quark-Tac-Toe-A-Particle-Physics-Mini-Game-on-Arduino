{Motivation}
Traditional educational tools often fall short when it comes to explaining abstract scientific topics like particle physics. This project aims to bridge that gap by gamifying concepts such as quark-lepton classification, weak interactions, and baryon formation through an interactive touch-based Arduino game.

{Concept Summary}
    A 3x3 touch interface represents the Tic-Tac-Toe grid.
    Each player uses particle symbols instead of X or O.
    Special combinations trigger \textit{interactions} such as decay or annihilation.
    Educational messages provide real-time feedback.
